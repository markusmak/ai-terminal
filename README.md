# ai-terminal
*Project: Build an AI Terminal so it can understand and process natural language terminal instructions.*

*Goal:*
1. Remind myself how to use Javascript
2. Give Langchain.JS a try
3. Learn about agent behaviors

*Key Learnings:*
1. Javascript is not the best for LLM dev. Stick with Python.
2. Langchain is too useful - the slight convenience is good for quick prototyping, but it is NOT significantly better compared to directly implementing the models themselves, which is the preferred approach for production. 
3. Langchain.JS is not very beginner friendly as the documentation is very thin.
